The purpose of this project is to introduce developers to mocking using PHPUnit.


## Setup

Here are the steps you need to go through to get the tests running. If you are having trouble then refer to the project [Sample PHPUnit Setup](https://github.com/bristol-php-training/phpunit-sample-setup)

### Requirements

Install the following:

- PHP 5.3 or higher
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) 

### Running composer

In the root directory of the project run composer. This will pull down all the dependencies:

```
composer install
```

### Running tests

You should now be able to run the unit tests. From the root directory of this project run:

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

You should see an output like this:

```
PHPUnit 4.8.0 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.



Time: 56 ms, Memory: 2.75MB

OK (1 test, 1 assertion)
```

The important bit is `OK (1 test, 1 assertion)` this means the tests have run successfully. 



## Next step

Type `git log -1` to see what the nest steps are.
